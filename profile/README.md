### JuliaImages: Image Processing and Computer Vision in Julia
----

JuliaImages hosts a collection of powerful image processing tools with a range of useful algorithms written in Julia, 
a modern and expressive high-level programming language.

JuliaImages prioritizes clean architecture and strives to bridge the gap between the "machine vision" and "biomedical 3D image processing" communities.
With a unified platform, JuliaImages empowers researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in these fields to leverage Julia's performance advantages
and collaborate more effectively in advancing image processing techniques.
